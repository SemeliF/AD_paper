Code used in the paper 'qEEG Analysis in the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease; Comparison of Functional Connectivity and Spectral Analysis'

To better understand the methodology, the first file that should be opened is "AD_EEG_analysis.m". This code pre-processes the EEG data, calculates the Power Spectral Density (PSD) and the Phase-Locking Values (PLV).

Next, please open the file "spectral_analysis.R". This code performs the statistical tests used for the spectral analysis (i.e. Method 1).

Lastly, the files "connectivity_analysis_RQ1.R" and "connectivity_analysis_RQ2.R" contain the statistical code for the functional connectivity analysis (i.e. Method 2), which includes the answer to RQ2.
